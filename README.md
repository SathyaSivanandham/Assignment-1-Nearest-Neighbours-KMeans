Use KNearestNeighbourRegressor to Predict Price of House.  
Here is the dataset https://github.com/edyoda/data-science-complete-tutorial/blob/master/Data/house_rental_data.csv.txt    
Use pandas to get some insights into the data (10 marks) 
Show some interesting visualization of the data (10 marks) 
Manage data for training &amp; testing (20) 
Finding a better value of k (10)


# ML-Cluster-similar-Houses

Again, on the same dataset. Cluster similar houses together. Here is the dataset https://github.com/edyoda/data-science-complete-tutorial/blob/master/Data/house_rental_data.csv.txt



Data cleaning & getting rid of irrelevant information before clustering
Finding the optimal value of k
Storing cluster to which the house belongs along with the data
